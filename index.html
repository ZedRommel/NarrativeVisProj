        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Climate change has been one of the most seriouos problem the humen being is facing currently. Automobiles are believed one of the most significant factors which worses the climate condition. With the advance of automobile, cars are equipped with more and more engine cylinders though people seems not realize how this affect the climate. On the other hand, the raise of electric cars provide a wiser travelling method without compromising the climate condition.
        </p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p> MPG is used to measure how far a car can travel for every gallon of fuel it uses. In this project, I explored how different number of engine cylinders, car brands and types of fuel affect the mileage a car can travel in unit fuel. </p>
